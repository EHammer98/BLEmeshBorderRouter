F1: first setup with the following functions:
connect
refreshMesh (shows only device index and UUID)
switchOn
switchOff
lightStat (plain response)
addDev
removeDev (untested)

F2:
meshRefresh: showing more info (full JSON DB file) instead of only UUID)
lightStat: filterd response so it can be used by other programs
removeDev: (tested)
