F1: first setup with the following functions:
•	connect
•	refreshMesh (shows only device index and UUID)
•	switchOn
•	switchOff
•	lightStat (plain response)
•	addDev
•	removeDev (untested)


F2: Update
•	meshRefresh: showing more info instead of only UUID, full JSON SB export
•	removeDev tested
•	lightStat: filterd response so it can be used by other programs
•	Provisioning: filterd response so you know how much times you need to push the button
•	New function: group, this function will take care of binding and grouping nodes
